itunes-cleaner
==============

Basically my iTunes DB is a mess and has a bunch of songs (177 to be exact)
in duplicate. Fixing it manually is really a hassle.

Status: shows you what tunes appear to be duplicates

Next: be smarter about finding dupes

After that: be able to fix the issues interactively and sanely
